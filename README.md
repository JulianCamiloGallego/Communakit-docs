# Communakit-docs

This repository is the host of the mkdocs documentation for the Communakit app.

## Intructions

First of all intall mkdocs by running **pip install mkdocs**

If you get a error, [checkout the installation guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/)

MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the **mkdocs serve** command
